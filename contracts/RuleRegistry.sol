/**
 * @title RuleRegistry
 * @author x402-cre-alerts
 * @notice On-chain registry for storing crypto price alert rules
 * 
 * @dev This contract serves as both:
 * 1. A Chainlink CRE (Chainlink Runtime Environment) receiver that accepts reports
 *    from CRE workflows containing price alert rules
 * 2. An x402 payment receiver that can accept USDC payments and allow owner withdrawals
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * - Rules are written to the contract via CRE workflow reports
 * - Rules are stored in a mapping with incremental IDs for efficient iteration
 * - The contract can receive USDC payments (from x402 protocol)
 * - Only the owner can withdraw accumulated USDC
 * 
 * Flow:
 * 1. CRE workflow receives alert data from server
 * 2. CRE workflow encodes alert data and sends report to this contract
 * 3. Contract decodes report and stores rule in mapping
 * 4. CRE cron job monitors prices and checks rules against current prices
 * 5. When conditions are met, notifications are sent via Pushover API
